# 3D Creative Portfolio Website - Final code
This is the final code for the YouTube tutorial course where we build a 3D animated creative portfolio using Next.js, Prismic, GSAP, and Three.js.

For more information and to watch the course go to the [course documentation](https://prismic.notion.site/Course-Resources-3D-Portfolio-Site-331e3f2b39d642e2bddf8ebf234a4386?pvs=74).

## Skip the tutorial and launch the site
If you don’t want to go through the tutorial, but want your own version of the website deployed on Prismic, follow these directions:

1. Clone the code:
    ```tsx
    npx @slicemachine/init@latest --starter course-creative-portfolio-next
    ```
    
2. Open the Prismic repository and select “English - United States”.
3. Run the content set up script:
    ```tsx
    npm run set-up-content
    ```
    
4. Open the migration release and publish it. A URL to the migration release will be printed on the screen.
5. Set up the slice simulator URL: `http://localhost:3000/slice-simulator`
